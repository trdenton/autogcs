to use:
- add userscript.js as a tampermonkey user script
- navigate to gcsurplus for sale items, select region (e.g. ontario)/other criteria and click 'search'
- this script will click through all the results while logging items that match Toronto / North York
- once there are no more 'next' pages it will display all logged results on one big page
- note: currently this is filtering for Toronto / North York, edit the script to change to your preference



The script uses persistent storage to keep results between page reloads.  There is a timer to clean up the cache after 1 minute of displaying the final results.  If you run the whole routine again within a minute of getting the final display, you will get duplicates of everything
