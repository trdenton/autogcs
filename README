to use:
- add userscript.js as a tampermonkey user script
- navigate to gcsurplus for sale items, select region (e.g. ontario) and criteria and click 'search'
- this script will click through all the results while logging items
- once there are no more results it will display all the results on one big page
- note: currently this is filtering for Toronto / North York, edit the script to change
